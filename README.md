Currency Converter is an android application, where we can convert cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) to US dollar (USD) and vice versa. This version of the application asks the user to put any positive amount of number that the user wants to convert, then select from three of the options such as: USD, Bitcoins and LTC.
After putting the amount and selecting the currency, users selects the currency in which the amount will be converted. On pressing the Convert button, the result will be shown in the bottom.

Extra Feature: When the user does not put any input/ amount (i.e. the input field is blank) and presses the convert button, it gives a message/warning on the screen “Please enter a number” which means user has to put an amount, so it can be converted accordingly. 

The online sources were mainly stack over flow, watching videos about different features of android studio and the documentation of android studio.
